# Bodyspec 
A body spectating plugin designed for Reddit UHC matches using the 1.8 spectating mode
## Further Development
I am updating the code for now, however, this could change at any time for any reason. Any one is free to use this code or recreate the project.

## This plugin is Mostly Complete
I have not implemented any customization or flexibility, but it should be compliant with all the Hosting Advisory's rules. This plugin blocks the use of highlight players, prevents the player from leaving ther teammate's view and fixes teleport desync.
If you wish to implement body spectating on your server you may use the this plugin but you must get approval from the hosting advisory.
